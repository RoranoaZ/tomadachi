# tomadachi Game

virtual pet game system based on OOP in python. Which allows the user to generate a pet with random characteristics and take care of it as well as interact.

A brief breakdown of its function:

1. The code starts by importing the random module, which is used for generating random values.

2. The code defines a class called pet with an __init__ method. The __init__ method initializes the attributes of a pet, such as colour, animal, and sound.

3. The pet class also has a tomadachi method that prints the pet's color, animal type, and sound.

4. The code defines another class called characteristics with an __init__ method. This class represents the characteristics of the pet, including attributes like hunger, personality, tricks, and intelligence.

5. The characteristics class has a method named hungry_or_not, which prints the pet's hunger level and prompts the user to feed the pet if it is hungry.

6. The code generates random values for the pet's hunger, personality, tricks, and intelligence using the random module and assigns them to variables.

7. The user is prompted to press to choose a random tomadachi.

8. If the user chooses "1", an instance of the pet class is created with the randomly chosen attributes for color, animal type, and sound. The tomadachi method is then called to display the pet's appearance.

9. The user is prompted to give a name to their pet.

10. The code checks if the user wants to check the pet's hunger level. If they press Enter, an instance of the characteristics class is created with the randomly generated hunger, personality, tricks, and intelligence values. The hungry_or_not method is then called to check the pet's hunger and allow the user to feed the pet if needed.

Conclusively, the code simulates the creation and management of a virtual pet by generating random attributes and providing options to check and feed the pet based on its hunger level.
